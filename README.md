# Basic form

This project was made to learn and test basic form validation ways and using a custom hook for that.

## What you can do here?

You can fill in a form with a name, surname and email address. The validation will prevent you from writing an incorrect email or leave an empty field. The "Submit" button is disabled until all the fields are correctly fill in :)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
